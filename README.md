## Project Description
"__Mafia: The City of Sin__", with its basic RPG features is a text-based game that is a combined version of well-known "_Age of Empires_" and "[Omerta](https://www.barafranca.com)". It is a single/multi player (but not P2P) endless strategy game that players intend to complete the tasks based on committing a different sets of crimes and gain as much as possible experience(xp). As the tasks are completed, users will be able to gain skills and money with a rank increase. In the game, players will be able to buy upgrades and customisation depending on their money and rank: which will change their weapons, cars, production rate, bullet power, hourly income etc. Players will also gain money from selling their goods or trade them.
